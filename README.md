Marathon allows you to run several bash commands and configure them by steps, so if any previous level has failed the execution gets stoped after the current level ends.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'marathon'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install marathon

## Usage

To set rspec to run after all linters and static analizers:
```bash
marathon -c 'bundle exec rspec;;2','yarn test','bundle exec rubocop','bundle exec brakeman','yarn run js-lint','yarn run css-lint'
```

To set rspec to run after rubocop and after frontend linters:
```bash
marathon -c 'yarn run js-lint','yarn run css-lint','bundle exec rubocop;;2','bundle exec rspec;;3'
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
